As we all know, javascript is, in the truest sense of the phrase, a magical language.


## Schrodinger's number

```js
typeof NaN === 'number'
```

Something that's not a number, is a number.

**Be Amazed!**



## Schrodinger's function

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Image of typeof myFunction <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
```js
typeof myFunction === 'function';
```

For my next trick, I'm gonna make this function... dissappear!

Abrakadabra!!

```js
myFunction();
```

**Be Amaaazed!!**


Here's the function,

```js
const myFunction = ''.split.call;
```

`call` is a method on the class `Function` so when you call it without it, it won't know what function to execute.

## Schrodinger's array

```js
document.all
```

Now let's make that array dissappear!

```js
typeof document.all
```

**BE AMAAAZZEEDDD!!!**

`document.all` is a very old and deprecated api that allowed you to iterate over all the nodes rendered to the DOM. So the typeof expression returning `undefined` was by design as a part of the deprecation.


## Check if list has length <= 1

So a simpleton would solve the given problem by writing something simple and dumb like
```js
const hasAtLeastOneItem = list => list.length <= 1;
```

But us few elite JS developers are smart enough to do this

```js
const hasAtLeastOneItem = list => !isNaN(+list);
```

Boom! **Now you are amazed!**
